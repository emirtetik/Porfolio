## **About the Project**

Bileton is a ticket sales site that was required as a final project. It is a project with an admin panel, developed by teams of 4 people, handling both backend and frontend sides.

## **Project Features**

Bileton is designed as a platform where users can easily purchase event tickets. Some of the key features the project offers:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A modern and easy-to-use interface developed with MUI and React.
- **Admin Panel**: The admin panel allows easy management of events, users, and ticket sales.
- **Ticket Sales Process**: Users can browse events, view details, and purchase tickets.
- **Data Management**: Data management is handled using Redux and Axios, with API calls integrated with the backend.

## Technology Selection

- **React and MUI (Material UI)**: A fast and dynamic user interface was created with React, and the user interface components were customized using MUI.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit was used for application state management. Processes such as user logins, events, and ticket sales are managed with Redux.
- **Axios**: Axios was used for communication with the backend API. Users can request information about events and tickets through this API.
- **Leaflet**: Leaflet was used to display event locations on a map.

## Admin Panel of the Application

The admin panel enables administrator users to easily manage all events, ticket sales, and user operations. Admins can add, delete, or edit events. They can also view user and ticket data.

## User Experience

Bileton prioritizes user experience by enabling users to quickly find events and purchase tickets. It visually presents information such as event details, dates, prices, and locations, helping users easily choose the best events.

## Performance and Speed

The project was developed with a focus on performance to improve user experience. Speed is prioritized especially in page transitions and content loading. Libraries like `react-virtualized` ensure that large data sets are displayed quickly and efficiently.
