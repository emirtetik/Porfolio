## **About the Project**

Tetrig is an innovative platform developed to support local cafes in providing faster, more efficient, and modern service to their customers. It offers solutions for both customer and business needs, aiming to make the café experience more practical and enjoyable. With Tetrig, customers can easily discover cafes in selected cities or districts, view the café's occupancy status in real-time, access menu and pricing information before entering the café, learn about the café's concept through descriptions, and easily access the café’s location via the address feature.

Businesses can quickly access important data such as daily total revenue, per-table income analysis, and the daily revenue of each table. One of Tetrig’s standout features is its integration with QR code technology for ordering. This system allows customers to access the digital menu and place orders by scanning the QR code on the table without the need to call the waiter. This feature enhances business efficiency while providing customers with a fast and seamless service experience. Tetrig aims to simplify business management while offering customers a modern and user-friendly experience, providing a simple yet effective solution.

## **What Makes Tetrig Different from Other Taxi Apps and Why Is It Necessary?**

It is anticipated that other applications (Tag, Uber, BiTaksi) will not be able to solve the transportation issue by increasing the number of individual drivers and allowing customers to send requests to individual drivers. These apps aim to increase the number of drivers in their applications to divide the annual $4.8 billion taxi turnover among more people and take a larger share of the sector. While it may seem that more drivers will make it easier for customers to find a ride, it’s important to note that this means dividing that money among more drivers, which will make it impossible for any driver to earn a living by working solely through these apps. 

The problem arises because adding more drivers to the traffic will not solve the issue; in fact, it will create more problems. More drivers will lead to increased traffic, resulting in time and fuel costs, ultimately lowering profit margins. As more private apps like Tag are introduced, Uber and similar apps will enter the market as well. This will make it impossible to predict the number of private taxis in the market. Many people in our country will take up driving as a part-time job. 

As a result, over 200,000 taxi drivers will have to either lose their jobs or work part-time. Additionally, the value of taxi plates, which were purchased with millions of lira, will decrease, creating a situation where taxi plates no longer have any value. While trying to fix the sector, we might end up killing it. Instead of freeing the public from taxi moguls, private apps may take over, and drivers will earn less. TaxiGig, based on these predictions, aims to provide a solution by offering safe and quick transportation without leaving it to individual drivers' discretion, ensuring driver safety, reducing traffic, saving time, and increasing fuel efficiency. In this way, TaxiGig is designed to solve the dual taxi problem in our country.
