## **About the Project**

Alieswolf is built on the Next.js framework. Next.js is a React-based web framework that makes it easier to develop fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Next.js works with a page-based structure and provides fast loading times thanks to pre-rendering. By using Next.js in Alieswolf, I offer dynamic and engaging user experiences.

**Nextjs, AOS, React Icons, React-Bootstrap**
