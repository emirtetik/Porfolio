## **About the Project**

Taxigig is an app developed to provide an innovative solution to the existing taxi services. Unlike other apps, it argues that simply adding more taxis or solving the problem by increasing the number of individual taxi drivers is not enough. Instead, it believes that the problem can be overcome by increasing trust in existing taxis and utilizing them more efficiently, which will lead to more earnings with fewer kilometers. Taxigig aims to connect passengers and drivers more effectively and efficiently. In this regard, it aims to increase taxi drivers' profit margins, redesign public taxi usage, minimize the likelihood of a taxi not arriving when called, improve service quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## **What sets Taxigig apart from other taxi apps and why should it be?**

It is anticipated that other apps (like Tag, Uber, BiTaksi) will not solve the transportation issue by increasing the number of individual drivers and having customers send requests to these drivers. The goal of these apps is to increase the number of drivers in their applications, thereby dividing the annual taxi turnover of 4.8 billion dollars among more people and capturing a larger share of the industry. While more drivers may seem to make it easier for customers to reach drivers, the key point here is that increasing the number of drivers means dividing this money among more drivers, which will result in no driver being able to make a living solely from working on these apps. The reason for this is that increasing the number of drivers will bring more vehicles to the streets, which will not solve the problem but rather create more issues. Because drivers will increase traffic in order to earn money, it will lead to time and fuel costs, lowering profit margins. If private apps like Tag are launched, more apps like Uber will also enter the sector. As a result, it is unpredictable how many private taxis there will be. In our country, many people will start driving as a part-time job. 

As a result, more than 200,000 taxi drivers in the country will either be out of work or need to work part-time. Furthermore, the value of taxi plates, which were bought for millions of TL, will decrease, and a period where the value of taxi plates no longer exists will be created. While trying to fix an industry, we may end up killing it. While trying to serve the public and free them from taxi monopolies, private apps might dominate, and drivers will earn less. TaxiGig is an app created to solve the two-sided taxi problem in our country, based on these predictions, with its solution-oriented approach, offering passengers safe and fast transportation without relying on individual drivers' initiative, and providing drivers with safety, reducing traffic, saving time, and reducing fuel consumption.
