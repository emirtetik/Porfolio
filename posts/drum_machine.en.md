## **Key Features of the Project:**
The Drum Machine is a project that was assigned to me during my training.

- **Drum Pad Bank:** Users can switch between two different drum pad banks.

- **Sound Playback:** A sound is played whenever a drum pad is pressed. It can also be triggered using keyboard keys.

- **Power Control:** Users can toggle the sound on or off.

- **State Management:** State management is handled using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

This project is a great example for those wanting to learn the basics of React and build an interactive application.
