## **About the Project**

Voxnet Hosting is where I took my first steps in coding while interning in server management. During this process, I started software development by reviewing HTML and CSS code on the Voxnet site, making various adjustments, and debugging errors. This project provided me with valuable experience in learning and applying basic web technologies.
