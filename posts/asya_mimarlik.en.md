## **About the Project**

Asya Mimarl覺k is one of the leading construction and real estate companies in the Kocaeli region. With its many years of experience and successful projects in Kocaeli, the company stands out in the industry. The company always prioritizes customer satisfaction by providing innovative and high-quality solutions in architectural projects.

To create the Asya Mimarl覺k website, I used the following technologies and libraries: 

- **Next.js:** I chose the Next.js framework to improve performance and create an SEO-friendly website with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) capability.

- **i18next:** To provide multi-language support for the project, I used the i18next library. This allows users to view the website in their preferred languages.

- **Sanity CMS:** I chose Sanity CMS for content management. To easily organize and manage data, I used Sanity Studio.
